# Progress - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## What Works

### Complete Implementation ✅
- **DFLD HTML Parsing**: Full implementation with InMemoryMeasurementProvider
- **Area Element Grouping**: HTML area pairs processed correctly for time/date extraction
- **Time Zone Conversion**: CET to UTC conversion implemented
- **Peak Measurement Selection**: Identifies highest noise levels from measurement periods
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: NoiseLevelMapper calls backend POST endpoints successfully
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing with DfldHtml test utility
- **Cypress E2E CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with Docker integration, artifact passing, and automated testing

### User Interface ✅
- **Event Recording**: One-click timestamp capture during noise events
- **Geolocation Integration**: Browser-based location discovery
- **Measurement Station Discovery**: Automatic station selection for user location
- **German Language UI**: Localized for target user base

### Core Architecture ✅
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain separated from web layer
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container configuration
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Modern ES6 modules with strong typing
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment ready
- **Request/Response Models**: NoiseMeasurementRequest and NoiseMeasurementResponse
- **Domain Models**: Immutable record structs for reliable data handling

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 2 Current Priorities 📋 - CI/CD Pipeline Optimization
1. **Docker Layer Caching** (High Impact: 30-40s savings)
   - Implement GitHub Actions cache for Docker builds
   - Add `cache-from: type=gha` and `cache-to: type=gha,mode=max`
   - Target: Reduce build time from 49s to 10-15s

2. **Pipeline Structure Optimization** (Medium Impact: 15-25s savings)
   - Remove unnecessary Docker Buildx setup in E2E job
   - Optimize Cypress dependencies caching
   - Eliminate redundant determine_tag job

3. **Performance Validation** 
   - Measure actual pipeline performance improvements
   - Validate cache hit rates and resource efficiency
   - Ensure reliability maintained through optimizations

### Deferred Phase 1 Polish Items 📋
- **Production Polish**: Controller TODO comments and test coverage
- **Complaint Export Feature**: Structured data export for official submissions
- **End-to-End Workflow Validation**: Complete user journey testing

### Future Enhancements 📋
- **Multi-Region Support**: Expand beyond Cologne/Bonn region
- **Persistent Storage**: Database integration for event history
- **Automated Submissions**: Direct integration with complaint systems
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly event recording interface

## Current Status

### Development Phase
**Phase 1**: Core Functionality - **COMPLETE** ✅
- ✅ Event recording system
- ✅ Infrastructure and architecture  
- ✅ Frontend-backend integration
- ✅ DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented
- ✅ Cypress E2E CI pipeline operational

**Phase 2**: CI/CD Pipeline Optimization - **IN PROGRESS** 🚧
- 📋 Docker layer caching implementation (target: 30-40s savings)
- 📋 Pipeline structure optimization (target: 15-25s savings)
- 📋 Performance validation and measurement

### Technical Considerations
- **DFLD HTML Structure**: Parsing depends on stable `<area>` tag title structure
- **Single Region Scope**: Limited to Cologne/Bonn region with hardcoded station data (acceptable for current scope)
- **Manual Export Required**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)
- **TODO Comments**: Some controller TODOs need addressing with proper test coverage

### Deployment Status
- **Development**: Fast iteration with hot reload working
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with DfldHtml test utility plus working Cypress E2E CI
- **Containerization**: Docker deployment ready for production
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing with GitHub Actions, Docker artifact passing, and green E2E tests
- **Architecture**: Supports current single-region deployment scope

## Known Issues

### CI/CD Performance Issues (Phase 2 Focus)
1. **Slow Pipeline**: 3-minute runtime impacts developer productivity
2. **No Docker Caching**: Rebuilds from scratch every run, wastes resources
3. **Redundant Setup**: Unnecessary Docker Buildx in E2E job adds overhead
4. **Large Artifacts**: 91MB Docker tar file for job transitions

### Application Technical Considerations (Phase 1 Complete)
1. **Browser Requirements**: Geolocation API requires HTTPS and user permission
2. **Controller TODOs**: Some TODO comments need resolution with proper test coverage (deferred)

### Current Scope Limitations
1. **Manual Export**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)
2. **No Persistence**: Events lost on browser refresh (acceptable for current scope)
3. **TypeScript Module Complexity**: Browser ES6 modules require .js extensions in imports
