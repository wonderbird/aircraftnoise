# Progress - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## What Works

### Complete Implementation âœ…
- **DFLD HTML Parsing**: Full implementation with InMemoryMeasurementProvider
- **Area Element Grouping**: HTML area pairs processed correctly for time/date extraction
- **Time Zone Conversion**: CET to UTC conversion implemented
- **Peak Measurement Selection**: Identifies highest noise levels from measurement periods
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: NoiseLevelMapper calls backend POST endpoints successfully
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing with DfldHtml test utility
- **Cypress E2E CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with Docker integration, artifact passing, and automated testing
- **Event-to-Measurement Correlation**: Fixed to use actual event timestamps instead of current time
- **Clean Refactoring**: Controller naming consistency (singular resources) and property naming standards
- **Production Logging**: Debug logging implemented in controllers for troubleshooting

### User Interface âœ…
- **Event Recording**: One-click timestamp capture during noise events
- **Geolocation Integration**: Browser-based location discovery
- **Measurement Station Discovery**: Automatic station selection for user location
- **German Language UI**: Localized for target user base

### Core Architecture âœ…
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain separated from web layer
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container configuration
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Modern ES6 modules with strong typing
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment ready
- **Request/Response Models**: NoiseMeasurementRequest and NoiseMeasurementResponse
- **Domain Models**: Immutable record structs for reliable data handling

## What's Left to Build

### Current Priorities ðŸ“‹
1. **Production Hardening**
   - Fix GetPeak() safety issue (crashes on empty measurement data)
   - Improve API design for no-data scenarios (replace HasMeasurement boolean)
   - Complete frontend error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Add comprehensive edge case test coverage

2. **Complaint Export Feature**
   - Design structured data export format (JSON, CSV, or text)
   - Implement export functionality for official complaint submission
   - Connect export to recorded events and their mapped noise levels

3. **End-to-End Workflow Validation**
   - Test complete user journey from start to finish
   - Validate with live DFLD data from RÃ¶srath-Forsbach station
   - Ensure all error handling paths work correctly

### Future Enhancements ðŸ“‹
- **Multi-Region Support**: Expand beyond Cologne/Bonn region
- **Persistent Storage**: Database integration for event history
- **Automated Submissions**: Direct integration with complaint systems
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly event recording interface


## Current Status

### Development Phase
**Phase 1**: Core Functionality
- âœ… Event recording system
- âœ… Infrastructure and architecture
- âœ… Frontend-backend integration
- âœ… DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented
- âœ… Event-to-measurement correlation working correctly
- ðŸ“‹ Production hardening and complaint export (current focus)

### Technical Considerations
- DFLD HTML parsing depends on stable structure
- Single region scope (acceptable for prototype)
- Manual export required (no direct API integration)
- Error handling gaps need addressing

## Known Issues

### Critical Production Issues
1. GetPeak() method crashes on empty measurement data
2. API design uses HasMeasurement boolean instead of HTTP status codes
3. Frontend error handling incomplete

### Current Scope Limitations
1. Manual export required (no API integration available)
2. No persistence (acceptable for prototype)
3. Single region support only

## Next Milestones

### Current Sprint
- [x] Fix GetPeak() safety issue for empty measurement data
- [x] Improve API design for no-data scenarios
- [ ] Complete frontend error handling implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive edge case test coverage
- [ ] Peak detection shall consider 10 minutes around event timestamp
- [ ] Implement complaint export functionality
- [ ] Validate end-to-end user workflow

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Multi-region support expansion
- [ ] Persistent storage for event history
- [ ] Mobile optimization for better event recording
