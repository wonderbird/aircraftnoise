# Progress - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## What Works

### Complete Implementation ✅
- **DFLD HTML Parsing**: Full implementation with InMemoryMeasurementProvider
- **Area Element Grouping**: HTML area pairs processed correctly for time/date extraction
- **Time Zone Conversion**: CET to UTC conversion implemented
- **Peak Measurement Selection**: Identifies highest noise levels from measurement periods
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: NoiseLevelMapper calls backend POST endpoints successfully
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing with DfldHtml test utility
- **Cypress E2E CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with Docker integration, artifact passing, and automated testing
- **Event-to-Measurement Correlation**: Fixed to use actual event timestamps instead of current time
- **Clean Refactoring**: Controller naming consistency (singular resources) and property naming standards
- **Production Logging**: Debug logging implemented in controllers for troubleshooting

### User Interface ✅
- **Event Recording**: One-click timestamp capture during noise events
- **Geolocation Integration**: Browser-based location discovery
- **Measurement Station Discovery**: Automatic station selection for user location
- **German Language UI**: Localized for target user base

### Core Architecture ✅
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain separated from web layer
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container configuration
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Modern ES6 modules with strong typing
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment ready
- **Request/Response Models**: NoiseMeasurementRequest and NoiseMeasurementResponse
- **Domain Models**: Immutable record structs for reliable data handling

## What's Left to Build

### Current Priorities 📋
1. **Production Hardening**
   - Fix GetPeak() safety issue (crashes on empty measurement data)
   - Improve API design for no-data scenarios (replace HasMeasurement boolean)
   - Complete frontend error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Add comprehensive edge case test coverage

2. **Complaint Export Feature**
   - Design structured data export format (JSON, CSV, or text)
   - Implement export functionality for official complaint submission
   - Connect export to recorded events and their mapped noise levels

3. **End-to-End Workflow Validation**
   - Test complete user journey from start to finish
   - Validate with live DFLD data from Rösrath-Forsbach station
   - Ensure all error handling paths work correctly

### Future Enhancements 📋
- **Multi-Region Support**: Expand beyond Cologne/Bonn region
- **Persistent Storage**: Database integration for event history
- **Automated Submissions**: Direct integration with complaint systems
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly event recording interface

## Technical Debt and Risk Assessment

### Security Risks

**Input Validation and XSS**:
- **XSS potential**: User-generated event data not properly sanitized
- Missing input validation across domain layers
- Error messages may expose sensitive system information

**Data Security**:
- No validation logic in domain objects
- User input processing lacks sanitization
- Browser storage security considerations

### Performance and Resource Risks

**Memory Management**:
- **Memory usage**: Measurement collections not disposed properly
- HTML parsing efficiency concerns with large datasets
- Global state management creates memory retention issues

**Resource Disposal**:
- Missing disposal patterns for external resources
- Collection lifecycle management needs improvement
- Browser memory usage monitoring required

### Maintainability Issues

**Code Quality Debt**:
- TODO comments proliferation in production code paths
- Missing validation implementations across layers
- Incomplete error handling scenarios throughout system

**Consistency Violations**:
- Mixed coding patterns and conventions
- Inconsistent async method patterns
- Property naming variations between layers

### Extensibility Concerns

**Architecture Coupling**:
- Tight coupling to DFLD HTML structure limits adaptability
- No abstraction for different measurement providers
- Frontend state management creates global coupling

**Integration Flexibility**:
- URL construction mixed with domain objects
- Missing provider abstraction for future integrations
- Static dependencies reduce extensibility options

## Current Status

### Development Phase
**Phase 1**: Core Functionality
- ✅ Event recording system
- ✅ Infrastructure and architecture
- ✅ Frontend-backend integration
- ✅ DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented
- ✅ Event-to-measurement correlation working correctly
- 📋 Production hardening and complaint export (current focus)

### Technical Considerations
- **DFLD HTML Structure**: Parsing depends on stable `<area>` tag title structure
- **Single Region Scope**: Limited to Cologne/Bonn region with hardcoded station data (acceptable for current scope)
- **Manual Export Required**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)
- **Error Handling Gaps**: GetPeak() method and frontend error handling need production-ready implementation

### Deployment Status
- **Development**: Fast iteration with hot reload working
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with DfldHtml test utility plus working Cypress E2E CI
- **Containerization**: Docker deployment ready for production
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing with GitHub Actions, Docker artifact passing, and green E2E tests
- **Architecture**: Supports current single-region deployment scope

## Known Issues

### Critical Production Issues
1. **GetPeak() Safety**: Method crashes on empty measurement data (NoiseMeasurementRange.cs:18)
2. **API Design**: HasMeasurement boolean violates REST principles (NoiseMeasurementResponse.cs:8)
3. **Frontend Error Handling**: Incomplete user feedback for network/backend failures

### Current Scope Limitations
1. **Manual Export**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)
2. **No Persistence**: Events lost on browser refresh (acceptable for current scope)
3. **TypeScript Module Complexity**: Browser ES6 modules require .js extensions in imports
