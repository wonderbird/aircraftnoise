# Active Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Complete the user experience and prepare for production deployment.

## Current Technical State

**Core Infrastructure Complete ✅**:
- DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented (InMemoryMeasurementProvider)
- Area element grouping working (pairs HTML elements for time/date extraction)
- Time zone conversion (CET to UTC) implemented
- Backend API with proper request/response models
- Frontend-backend integration working
- Peak measurement selection logic implemented
- Comprehensive test infrastructure with DfldHtml test utility

## Next Steps - Current Sprint

### 1. Polish Existing Functionality
- Remove TODO comments in controller and add proper tests
- Complete test coverage for peak measurement selection logic
- Consider controller renaming (PeakNoiseLevelController vs PeakNoiseLevelsController)

### 2. End-to-End Workflow Validation
- Test complete user journey: event recording → noise level retrieval → results display
- Validate with real DFLD data from Rösrath-Forsbach station
- Ensure error handling for edge cases

### 3. Complaint Export Feature
- Implement structured data export for official complaint submission
- Design export format (JSON, CSV, or structured text)
- Connect export to recorded events and their noise level mappings

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions
- **Production Readiness Focus**: Move from prototype to production-quality implementation
- **User Experience Priority**: Complete the full complaint preparation workflow
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain comprehensive testing as functionality is polished

### Development Standards
- **Clean Architecture**: Continue maintaining clear separation of concerns
- **Immutable Domain Objects**: Keep using record structs for reliable data handling
- **Test-Driven Development**: Address TODO comments with proper test coverage first

## Known Constraints

### External Dependencies
- **Browser Requirements**: Geolocation requires HTTPS and user permission  
- **Manual Export**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)

### Technical Limitations
- **In-Memory Storage**: No persistence between sessions (acceptable for current scope)

## Current Sprint Definition of Done

- [ ] TODO comments resolved with proper test coverage
- [ ] Peak measurement selection logic fully tested
- [ ] Complete user workflow validated (event recording → noise level display)
- [ ] Complaint export functionality implemented
- [ ] Error handling verified for edge cases
