# Progress - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## What Works

### Complete Implementation âœ…
- **DFLD HTML Parsing**: Full implementation with InMemoryMeasurementProvider
- **Area Element Grouping**: HTML area pairs processed correctly for time/date extraction
- **Time Zone Conversion**: CET to UTC conversion implemented
- **Peak Measurement Selection**: Identifies highest noise levels from measurement periods
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: NoiseLevelMapper calls backend POST endpoints successfully
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing with DfldHtml test utility

### User Interface âœ…
- **Event Recording**: One-click timestamp capture during noise events
- **Geolocation Integration**: Browser-based location discovery
- **Measurement Station Discovery**: Automatic station selection for user location
- **German Language UI**: Localized for target user base

### Core Architecture âœ…
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain separated from web layer
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container configuration
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Modern ES6 modules with strong typing
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment ready
- **Request/Response Models**: NoiseMeasurementRequest and NoiseMeasurementResponse
- **Domain Models**: Immutable record structs for reliable data handling

## What's Left to Build

### Current Priorities ðŸ“‹
1. **Production Polish**
   - Remove TODO comments in controller with proper test coverage
   - Complete test coverage for peak measurement selection logic
   - Validate error handling for all edge cases

2. **Complaint Export Feature**
   - Design structured data export format (JSON, CSV, or text)
   - Implement export functionality for official complaint submission
   - Connect export to recorded events and their mapped noise levels

3. **End-to-End Workflow Validation**
   - Test complete user journey from start to finish
   - Validate with live DFLD data from RÃ¶srath-Forsbach station
   - Ensure seamless user experience

### Future Enhancements ðŸ“‹
- **Multi-Region Support**: Expand beyond Cologne/Bonn region
- **Persistent Storage**: Database integration for event history
- **Automated Submissions**: Direct integration with complaint systems
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly event recording interface

## Current Status

### Development Phase
**Phase 1**: Core Functionality (95% Complete)
- âœ… Event recording system
- âœ… Infrastructure and architecture  
- âœ… Frontend-backend integration
- âœ… DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented
- ðŸ“‹ Production polish and complaint export (current focus)

### Technical Considerations
- **DFLD HTML Structure**: Parsing depends on stable `<area>` tag title structure
- **Single Region Scope**: Limited to Cologne/Bonn region with hardcoded station data (acceptable for current scope)
- **Manual Export Required**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)
- **TODO Comments**: Some controller TODOs need addressing with proper test coverage

### Deployment Status
- **Development**: Fast iteration with hot reload working
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with DfldHtml test utility
- **Containerization**: Docker deployment ready for production
- **Architecture**: Supports current single-region deployment scope

## Known Issues

### Technical Considerations
1. **DFLD HTML Structure Dependency**: Parsing depends on stable `<area>` tag title structure (external risk)
2. **Browser Requirements**: Geolocation API requires HTTPS and user permission
3. **Controller TODOs**: Some TODO comments need resolution with proper test coverage

### Current Scope Limitations
1. **Manual Export**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)
2. **Single Region**: Limited to Cologne/Bonn region with one measurement station
3. **No Persistence**: Events lost on browser refresh (acceptable for current scope)
4. **TypeScript Module Complexity**: Browser ES6 modules require .js extensions in imports

## Next Milestones

### Current Sprint
- [ ] Resolve controller TODO comments with proper test coverage
- [ ] Complete test coverage for peak measurement selection logic
- [ ] Implement complaint export functionality
- [ ] Validate end-to-end user workflow

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Multi-region support expansion
- [ ] Persistent storage for event history
- [ ] Mobile optimization for better event recording
