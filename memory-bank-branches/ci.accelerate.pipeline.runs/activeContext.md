# Active Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Optimize CI/CD pipeline performance to improve developer productivity and resource efficiency.

## Current Technical State

**Core Application Complete âœ…**:
- DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented (InMemoryMeasurementProvider)
- Area element grouping working (pairs HTML elements for time/date extraction)
- Time zone conversion (CET to UTC) implemented
- Backend API with proper request/response models
- Frontend-backend integration working
- Peak measurement selection logic implemented
- Comprehensive test infrastructure with DfldHtml test utility
- **Cypress E2E CI Pipeline**: Fully operational with Docker integration and automated testing

**Current Pipeline Performance**:
- **Total Runtime**: ~3 minutes (180 seconds)
- determine_tag: 2 seconds
- build: 49 seconds  
- e2e: 112 seconds
- **Resource Inefficiency**: No Docker layer caching, unnecessary buildx setup, large artifacts

## Current Sprint - Milestone 1: Docker Layer Caching Implementation
**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION | **Target**: Reduce build time from 49s to 9-19s (60-80% improvement)

**Current Focus**: Implementing GitHub Actions cache integration with Docker Buildx to achieve 30-40 second build time savings through intelligent layer caching.

**Next Immediate Steps**:
1. **Epic 1**: GitHub Actions cache integration - modify `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml` and optimize Dockerfile layer structure
2. **Epic 2**: Cache effectiveness validation - implement performance monitoring and test suite
3. **Epic 3**: Production rollout - gradual deployment and documentation updates

**Expected Outcome**: Overall pipeline duration reduced from 180s to 140-150s with this milestone.

## Future Milestones (Planning Phase)
### Milestone 2: E2E Test Optimization (Target: 40-50s savings)
### Milestone 3: Infrastructure Improvements (Target: 10-20s savings)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Performance Targets
- ðŸŽ¯ **Ideal Target**: <60 seconds (67% reduction from current 180s)
- âœ… **Acceptable Target**: <90 seconds (50% reduction)
- ðŸ“Š **Milestone**: <120 seconds (33% reduction) â†’ investigate further optimizations

### Optimization Principles
- **Developer Productivity Focus**: Pipeline runs multiple times daily, fast feedback essential
- **Resource Efficiency**: Eliminate redundant rebuilds through intelligent caching
- **Incremental Approach**: Implement high-impact optimizations first, measure results
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Avoid premium runners unless justified by significant gains

### Development Standards
- **Maintain Test Coverage**: Optimizations must not compromise E2E test reliability
- **Preserve Functionality**: All existing CI features must continue working
- **Measurement-Driven**: Track actual performance improvements with each change
- **Resource Awareness**: Monitor GitHub Actions cache usage and limits

## Known Constraints

### GitHub Actions Limitations
- **Cache Storage**: 10GB limit per repository, oldest entries evicted automatically
- **Cache Access**: Only current branch, base branch, and default branch caches accessible
- **Runner Performance**: Standard ubuntu-latest runners, upgrade costs vs. benefits

### Technical Dependencies
- **Docker Build Process**: Multi-stage build complexity affects caching efficiency
- **Artifact Size**: ~91MB Docker tar file for job transitions
- **Test Dependencies**: Cypress requires full application stack running

## Milestone 1 Success Criteria

**Primary KPI**: Build job duration reduced from 49s to 9-19s (60-80% improvement)
**Secondary KPI**: Overall pipeline duration reduced from 180s to 140-150s  
**Quality KPI**: No regression in build reliability or test effectiveness
**Resource KPI**: Cache storage usage under GitHub Actions limits
