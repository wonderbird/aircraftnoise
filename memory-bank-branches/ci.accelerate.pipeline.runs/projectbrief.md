# Project Brief - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Project Mission

**Motivate responsible parties to reduce aircraft noise** by streamlining the process of filing structured noise complaints with official German aviation authorities.

## Core Problem

Citizens affected by aircraft noise face barriers when filing complaints:
- Manual process of correlating noise events with official measurement data
- Complex workflow to access DFLD (German Aviation Noise Service) measurements  
- Time-consuming manual data entry into complaint systems
- Lack of structured event recording during noise disturbances

## Solution Approach

A web application that helps citizens:
1. **Record noise events** with precise timestamps during disturbances
2. **Automatically map events** to official DFLD measurement data
3. **Prepare structured complaints** with verified noise levels
4. **Streamline manual submission** to official complaint systems

## Target Users

German citizens affected by aircraft noise, particularly in the Cologne/Bonn airport region.

## Key Success Metrics

- Reduction in time required to file noise complaints
- Increase in complaint accuracy with official measurement data
- Improved citizen engagement with noise reduction efforts
- Higher complaint submission rates due to reduced friction

## Technical Constraints

- Integration with existing DFLD measurement stations (HTML parsing)
- German-language UI for local users
- Browser-based geolocation for station discovery
- Manual submission to official systems (no direct API integration)

## Current Scope

**Phase 1**: Core functionality for Cologne/Bonn region - **COMPLETE** ✅
- Single measurement station support (Rösrath-Forsbach)
- Basic event recording and noise level mapping
- Manual complaint preparation workflow
- Cypress E2E CI pipeline with Docker integration

**Phase 2 (Current)**: CI/CD Pipeline Optimization
- Reduce pipeline execution time from 3 minutes to <60 seconds (ideal) / <90 seconds (acceptable)
- Optimize resource usage through intelligent caching strategies
- Improve developer productivity with faster feedback loops

**Future Expansion**: Multi-region support, persistent storage, automated submissions
