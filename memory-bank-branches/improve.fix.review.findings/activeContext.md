# Active Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Complete the user experience and prepare for production deployment.

## Current Technical State

**Core Infrastructure Complete ✅**:
- DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented (InMemoryMeasurementProvider)
- Area element grouping working (pairs HTML elements for time/date extraction)
- Time zone conversion (CET to UTC) implemented
- Backend API with proper request/response models
- Frontend-backend integration working
- Peak measurement selection logic implemented
- Comprehensive test infrastructure with DfldHtml test utility
- **Cypress E2E CI Pipeline**: Fully operational with Docker integration and automated testing

## Next Steps - Current Sprint

### 1. Expand TDD Workflow with Comprehensive E2E Tests
- Build upon successful Cypress CI foundation with comprehensive user journey tests
- Write failing end-to-end test that demonstrates the correlation bug  
- Test should cover complete user journey: record event → get correct noise level for that event's timestamp
- Leverage working CI pipeline to catch regressions early in development process

### 2. Fix Critical Event-to-Measurement Correlation Bug (TDD: Red → Green)
- NoiseLevelMapper queries current time instead of actual event timestamps
- Fix TODO on line 31: "take end time and duration from the current event"  
- Make the end-to-end test pass, proving the bug is resolved

### 3. Apply TDD to Remaining TODO Comments
- Write failing tests first for controller TODOs
- Write failing tests first for peak measurement selection logic
- Then implement fixes to make tests pass (Red → Green → Refactor)

### 4. Complete End-to-End Workflow Validation
- Validate with real DFLD data from Rösrath-Forsbach station
- Ensure error handling for edge cases

### 3. Production Logging Strategy
- Add proper logging for debugging and monitoring
- Essential for production troubleshooting when users report issues
- Focus on key workflow points: event recording, DFLD data retrieval, noise level mapping

### 4. Complaint Export Feature
- Implement structured data export for official complaint submission
- Design export format (JSON, CSV, or structured text)
- Connect export to recorded events and their noise level mappings

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions
- **TDD Transition**: Establish Test-Driven Development workflow starting with end-to-end test
- **Production Readiness Focus**: Move from prototype to production-quality implementation
- **User Experience Priority**: Complete the full complaint preparation workflow
- **Test Coverage**: Write tests first, then implement (Red → Green → Refactor)

### Development Standards
- **Clean Architecture**: Continue maintaining clear separation of concerns
- **Immutable Domain Objects**: Keep using record structs for reliable data handling
- **Test-Driven Development**: Address TODO comments with proper test coverage first

## Known Constraints

### External Dependencies
- **Browser Requirements**: Geolocation requires HTTPS and user permission  
- **Manual Export**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)

### Technical Limitations
- **In-Memory Storage**: No persistence between sessions (acceptable for current scope)
