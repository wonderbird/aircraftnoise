# Project Brief - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Project Mission

**Motivate responsible parties to reduce aircraft noise** by streamlining the process of filing structured noise complaints with official German aviation authorities.

## Core Problem

Citizens struggle to file effective complaints due to manual correlation of noise events with official DFLD measurement data, complex workflows, and lack of structured event recording.

## Solution Approach

A web application that helps citizens:
1. **Record noise events** with precise timestamps during disturbances
2. **Automatically map events** to official DFLD measurement data
3. **Prepare structured complaints** with verified noise levels
4. **Streamline manual submission** to official complaint systems

## Target Users

German citizens affected by aircraft noise, particularly in the Cologne/Bonn airport region.

## Current Scope

**Phase 1**: Core functionality for Cologne/Bonn region
- Single measurement station support (RÃ¶srath-Forsbach)
- Event recording and noise level mapping
- Manual complaint preparation workflow
