# Active Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Production hardening and error handling robustness.

## Current Technical State

Core infrastructure complete: DFLD parsing, backend API, frontend integration, test infrastructure, and CI pipeline operational.

## Next Steps - Current Sprint

### 1. Fix GetPeak() Safety Critical Issue
- `GetPeak()` method crashes on empty measurement data
- Implement proper exception handling or optional return

### 2. Complete Frontend Error Handling
- Implement user-friendly error messages for backend failures
- Add graceful degradation for network issues

### 3. Add Comprehensive Edge Case Test Coverage
- Unit tests for empty measurement data scenarios
- Tests for network failure cases
- Tests for invalid timestamp ranges

### 4. Complete End-to-End Workflow Validation
- Validate complete user journey with real DFLD data
- Ensure all error handling paths work correctly

### 5. Complaint Export Feature Implementation
- Implement structured data export for official complaint submission
- Design export format and connect to recorded events

## Error Handling Strategy

**User Experience Goal**: Design error handling to keep users motivated to complete their complaint process.

### Frontend Error Handling Requirements
- Replace console logging with user-friendly messages
- Implement uniform error handling across all layers
- Ensure measurement failures don't break user workflow
- Design motivational error messages

## Current Technical Decisions
- Production hardening focus over new features
- TDD approach for edge cases
- REST API compliance with proper HTTP status codes
- Graceful degradation and meaningful error feedback

## Known Constraints
- Geolocation requires HTTPS and user permission
- Manual export required (no direct API integration available)
- In-memory storage only (acceptable for prototype)
