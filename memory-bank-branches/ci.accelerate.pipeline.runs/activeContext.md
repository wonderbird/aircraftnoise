# Active Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Optimize CI/CD pipeline performance to improve developer productivity and resource efficiency.

**Current Status**: Comprehensive analysis completed - identified high-impact optimization strategy targeting E2E bottleneck (90-120s of 180s total).

## Current Technical State

**Core Application Complete ‚úÖ**:
- DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented (InMemoryMeasurementProvider)
- Area element grouping working (pairs HTML elements for time/date extraction)
- Time zone conversion (CET to UTC) implemented
- Backend API with proper request/response models
- Frontend-backend integration working
- Peak measurement selection logic implemented
- Comprehensive test infrastructure with DfldHtml test utility
- **Cypress E2E CI Pipeline**: Fully operational with Docker integration and automated testing

**Pipeline Performance - NO IMPROVEMENT ACHIEVED** ‚ùå:
- **Runtime**: ~3 minutes (180 seconds) - **back to baseline**
- determine_tag: ~2-4 seconds
- build: ~45-60 seconds (no caching benefits)
- e2e: ~90-120 seconds
- **Caching Attempt**: Failed - removed due to no measurable improvements and flaky builds

## Current Sprint - Milestone 2: E2E Architecture Optimization
**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION ‚úÖ | **Strategy**: Target E2E bottleneck with architectural changes

**High-Impact Strategy Identified**: Remove Docker container overhead from E2E testing phase

**Prioritized Implementation Plan**:
1. **Epic 2.1**: Eliminate Docker Container Overhead (40-60s reduction potential)
   - Replace Docker container approach with direct `dotnet run` execution
   - Remove artifact upload/download/load cycle
   - Use cypress-io/github-action `start` parameter for app lifecycle
2. **Epic 2.2**: Node.js Dependency Caching (20-30s reduction potential)
   - Implement actions/cache@v3 for node_modules
   - Cache Cypress installation and dependencies between runs
3. **Epic 2.3**: Cypress Configuration Optimization (5-15s reduction potential)
   - Disable video recording: `CYPRESS_VIDEO=false`
   - Optimize Cypress config for single-test execution
   - Remove unnecessary Cypress features

**Combined Target**: 65-105s reduction from current 180s = **60-75s final pipeline duration**

## Next Milestones (Post E2E Optimization)
### Milestone 3: Advanced Optimizations (if needed)
- GitHub Actions runner upgrades (ubuntu-22.04 or larger runners)
- Build process parallelization
- Workflow job dependency optimization

### Future Expansion Readiness
- Pipeline optimizations proven for scalability
- Foundation for multi-region deployment CI/CD

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Performance Targets
- üéØ **Ideal Target**: <60 seconds (67% reduction from current 180s)
- ‚úÖ **Acceptable Target**: <90 seconds (50% reduction)
- üìä **Milestone**: <120 seconds (33% reduction) ‚Üí investigate further optimizations

### Optimization Principles (E2E Architecture Strategy)
- **Architectural Simplification**: Remove unnecessary complexity (Docker container overhead)  
- **Bottleneck Targeting**: Focus on highest-impact component (E2E: 50-67% of total time)
- **Proven Techniques**: Apply industry-validated optimization patterns
- **Measurement-Driven**: Verify actual improvements with multiple test runs
- **Reliability First**: Maintain test stability while improving performance
- **Progressive Implementation**: Implement highest-impact changes first

### Development Standards
- **Maintain Test Coverage**: Optimizations must not compromise E2E test reliability
- **Preserve Functionality**: All existing CI features must continue working
- **Measurement-Driven**: Track actual performance improvements with each change
- **Resource Awareness**: Monitor GitHub Actions cache usage and limits

## Known Constraints

### GitHub Actions Limitations
- **Cache Storage**: 10GB limit per repository, oldest entries evicted automatically
- **Cache Access**: Only current branch, base branch, and default branch caches accessible
- **Runner Performance**: Standard ubuntu-latest runners, upgrade costs vs. benefits

### Technical Dependencies
- **Docker Build Process**: Multi-stage build complexity affects caching efficiency
- **Artifact Size**: ~91MB Docker tar file for job transitions
- **Test Dependencies**: Cypress requires full application stack running

## Milestone 1 Results (Failed Implementation)

**Primary KPI**: Build job duration - NO IMPROVEMENT (remained ~45-60s)
**Secondary KPI**: Overall pipeline duration - NO IMPROVEMENT (remained ~180s)  
**Quality KPI**: Build reliability DEGRADED (flaky builds introduced)
**Resource KPI**: Cache storage used but provided no benefit

### Implementation Checklist (Post-Mortem)
- [x] **Epic 1.1**: GitHub Actions cache integration attempted and reverted ‚ùå
- [x] **Epic 1.2**: NuGet cache mounting attempted and reverted ‚ùå  
- [x] **Epic 2**: Cache effectiveness validation - proved ineffective ‚ùå
- [x] **Epic 3**: Production rollout - fully reverted ‚ùå
- [x] Initial measurements misleading - no reproducible benefits ‚ùå
- [x] Caching approach proven unsuitable for this project ‚ùå

## Success Metrics
