- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: NoiseLevelMapper calls backend POST endpoints successfully
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing with DfldHtml test utility
- **Cypress E2E CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with Docker integration, artifact passing, and automated testing

### User Interface âœ…
- **Event Recording**: One-click timestamp capture during noise events
- **Geolocation Integration**: Browser-based location discovery
- **Measurement Station Discovery**: Automatic station selection for user location
- **German Language UI**: Localized for target user base

### Core Architecture âœ…
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain separated from web layer
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container configuration
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Modern ES6 modules with strong typing
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment ready
- **Request/Response Models**: NoiseMeasurementRequest and NoiseMeasurementResponse
- **Domain Models**: Immutable record structs for reliable data handling

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 2 Current Priorities ðŸ“‹ - CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

#### Milestone 1: Docker Layer Caching Implementation - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Target**: Reduce build time from 49s to 9-19s (60-80% improvement)
**Total Story Points**: 10
**Expected Impact**: 30-40 second savings

##### Epic 1: GitHub Actions Cache Integration (5 Story Points)

**Task 1.1: Implement Docker Buildx with GitHub Actions Cache (3 SP)**
- Replace `docker build` with `docker buildx build` in `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`
- Add `--cache-from type=gha --cache-to type=gha,mode=max` parameters
- Configure cache scopes for branch-based caching (`aircraftnoise-main`, `aircraftnoise-pr-*`)
- Verify cache key generation uses Dockerfile content hash
- Build time reduced by minimum 20 seconds on cache hit

Technical Implementation:
```yaml
- name: Build Docker image with cache
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    file: ./Dockerfile
    tags: ${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
    load: true
```

**Task 1.2: Optimize Dockerfile Layer Structure for Caching (2 SP)**
- Separate Node.js installation into dedicated layer (early in build)
- Move dependency restoration before source code copy
- Optimize layer ordering for maximum cache hit potential
- Document layer caching strategy in comments

##### Epic 2: Cache Effectiveness Validation (3 Story Points)

**Task 2.1: Implement Pipeline Performance Monitoring (2 SP)**
- Add build time measurement to GitHub Actions workflow
- Create pipeline timing comparison between cache hit/miss scenarios
- Implement cache hit ratio monitoring
- Document performance baseline and improvements

**Task 2.2: Create Cache Performance Test Suite (1 SP)**
- Test cache behavior with fresh repository clone
- Test cache behavior with dependency changes
- Test cache behavior with source code changes only
- Validate cache storage cleanup and limits

##### Epic 3: Production Rollout (2 Story Points)

**Task 3.1: Implement Gradual Cache Rollout (1 SP)**
- Deploy cache implementation to feature branch first
- Validate performance on multiple PRs
- Monitor cache storage usage and costs
- Plan rollback strategy if issues arise

**Task 3.2: Update Documentation and Team Knowledge (1 SP)**
- Update memory bank with implementation details
- Document cache maintenance procedures
- Create team knowledge sharing session
- Update project README with performance improvements

##### Success Metrics for Milestone 1
- **Primary KPI**: Build job duration reduced from 49s to 9-19s (60-80% improvement)
- **Secondary KPI**: Overall pipeline duration reduced from 180s to 140-150s
- **Quality KPI**: No regression in build reliability or test effectiveness
- **Resource KPI**: Cache storage usage under GitHub Actions limits

#### Milestone 2: E2E Test Optimization (TBD: 40-50s savings potential)
#### Milestone 3: Infrastructure Improvements (TBD: 10-20s savings potential)

### Deferred Phase 1 Polish Items ðŸ“‹
- **Production Polish**: Controller TODO comments and test coverage
- **Complaint Export Feature**: Structured data export for official submissions
- **End-to-End Workflow Validation**: Complete user journey testing

### Future Enhancements ðŸ“‹
- **Multi-Region Support**: Expand beyond Cologne/Bonn region
- **Persistent Storage**: Database integration for event history
- **Automated Submissions**: Direct integration with complaint systems
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly event recording interface

## Current Status

### Development Phase
**Phase 1**: Core Functionality - **COMPLETE** âœ…
- âœ… Event recording system
- âœ… Infrastructure and architecture  
- âœ… Frontend-backend integration
- âœ… DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented
- âœ… Cypress E2E CI pipeline operational

**Phase 2**: CI/CD Pipeline Optimization - **IN PROGRESS** ðŸš§
- ðŸ“‹ **Milestone 1**: Docker layer caching implementation - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (target: 30-40s savings)
- ðŸ“‹ **Milestone 2**: E2E test optimization (target: 40-50s savings) 
- ðŸ“‹ **Milestone 3**: Infrastructure improvements (target: 10-20s savings)

### Technical Considerations
- **DFLD HTML Structure**: Parsing depends on stable `<area>` tag title structure
- **Single Region Scope**: Limited to Cologne/Bonn region with hardcoded station data (acceptable for current scope)
- **Manual Export Required**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)
- **TODO Comments**: Some controller TODOs need addressing with proper test coverage

### Deployment Status
- **Development**: Fast iteration with hot reload working
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with DfldHtml test utility plus working Cypress E2E CI
- **Containerization**: Docker deployment ready for production
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing with GitHub Actions, Docker artifact passing, and green E2E tests
- **Architecture**: Supports current single-region deployment scope

## Known Issues

### CI/CD Performance Issues (Phase 2 Focus)
1. **Slow Pipeline**: 3-minute runtime impacts developer productivity
2. **No Docker Caching**: Rebuilds from scratch every run, wastes resources
3. **Redundant Setup**: Unnecessary Docker Buildx in E2E job adds overhead
4. **Large Artifacts**: 91MB Docker tar file for job transitions

### Application Technical Considerations (Phase 1 Complete)
1. **Browser Requirements**: Geolocation API requires HTTPS and user permission
2. **Controller TODOs**: Some TODO comments need resolution with proper test coverage (deferred)

### Current Scope Limitations
1. **Manual Export**: Users must manually transfer data to complaint systems (no direct API integration available)
2. **No Persistence**: Events lost on browser refresh (acceptable for current scope)
3. **TypeScript Module Complexity**: Browser ES6 modules require .js extensions in imports
