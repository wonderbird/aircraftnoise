# Active Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Production hardening and error handling robustness.

## Current Technical State

Core infrastructure complete: DFLD parsing, backend API, frontend integration, test infrastructure, and CI pipeline operational.

**Recent Progress**: API design improved with HTTP 204 responses for no-data scenarios. HasMeasurement property removed. Controller-level safety checks added for empty measurement data.

## Critical Issues Identified (Code Review)

### 1. GetPeak() Domain Safety Issue
- Core domain method still throws InvalidOperationException on empty data
- Controller workaround implemented but domain method remains unsafe
- Violates defensive programming principles

### 2. Incomplete Error Handling Chain
- Backend returns proper HTTP 204 for no-data scenarios
- Frontend only logs to console - no user feedback
- Users don't understand when/why data is unavailable

### 3. Architecture Layer Violations
- Controller performing business logic (empty data checks)
- Should be handled by domain layer or measurement provider

## Next Steps - Current Sprint

### 1. Fix GetPeak() Domain Method
- Make GetPeak() return optional result instead of throwing
- Remove safety burden from all callers
- Implement proper defensive programming

### 2. Complete Frontend Error Handling
- Replace console logging with user-friendly messages
- Show clear feedback for no-data scenarios (HTTP 204)
- Add graceful degradation for network failures

### 3. Refactor Empty Data Handling
- Move business logic from controller to domain layer
- Ensure Clean Architecture compliance

### 4. For Demo: Allow to retrieve measurement data even when there is no data ready
- UI shall allow entering "demo mode"
- In demo mode, the app shall show a peak value for all recorded events

### 5. Add Comprehensive Edge Case Test Coverage
- Unit tests for empty measurement data scenarios
- Tests for network failure cases
- Tests for invalid timestamp ranges

### 6. Request DFLD permission to use the data
- Request permission to use data from DFLD
- Optional: Present the current idea to DFLD

### 7. Complete End-to-End Workflow Validation
- Validate complete user journey with real DFLD data
- Ensure all error handling paths work correctly

### 8. Complaint Export Feature Implementation
- Implement structured data export for official complaint submission
- Design export format and connect to recorded events

## Error Handling Strategy

**User Experience Goal**: Design error handling to keep users motivated to complete their complaint process.

### Frontend Error Handling Requirements
- Replace console logging with user-friendly messages
- Implement uniform error handling across all layers
- Ensure measurement failures don't break user workflow
- Design motivational error messages

## Current Technical Decisions
- Production hardening focus over new features
- TDD approach for edge cases
- REST API compliance with proper HTTP status codes
- Graceful degradation and meaningful error feedback

## Known Constraints
- Geolocation requires HTTPS and user permission
- Manual export required (no direct API integration available)
- In-memory storage only (acceptable for prototype)
