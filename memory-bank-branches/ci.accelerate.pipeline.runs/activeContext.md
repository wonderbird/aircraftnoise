# Active Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Optimize CI/CD pipeline performance to improve developer productivity and resource efficiency.

**Current Status**: Back to baseline performance after failed caching implementation. Need to reassess optimization strategy.

## Current Technical State

**Core Application Complete ‚úÖ**:
- DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented (InMemoryMeasurementProvider)
- Area element grouping working (pairs HTML elements for time/date extraction)
- Time zone conversion (CET to UTC) implemented
- Backend API with proper request/response models
- Frontend-backend integration working
- Peak measurement selection logic implemented
- Comprehensive test infrastructure with DfldHtml test utility
- **Cypress E2E CI Pipeline**: Fully operational with Docker integration and automated testing

**Pipeline Performance - NO IMPROVEMENT ACHIEVED** ‚ùå:
- **Runtime**: ~3 minutes (180 seconds) - **back to baseline**
- determine_tag: ~2-4 seconds
- build: ~45-60 seconds (no caching benefits)
- e2e: ~90-120 seconds
- **Caching Attempt**: Failed - removed due to no measurable improvements and flaky builds

## Current Sprint - Milestone 1: Docker Layer Caching Implementation  
**Status**: FAILED AND REVERTED ‚ùå | **Outcome**: No measurable performance improvements, introduced build instability

**Failed Implementation**: GitHub Actions cache integration and NuGet cache mounting were implemented but removed after comprehensive testing showed no real performance benefits and caused flaky builds.

**Implementation Results**:
1. **Epic 1.1**: GitHub Actions cache integration - ‚ùå FAILED
   - Added `cache-from: type=gha` and `cache-to: type=gha,mode=max` parameters
   - Initial measurements appeared promising but were not reproducible
   - Removed in commit 09e7e15 due to no measurable improvements
2. **Epic 1.2**: NuGet cache mounting - ‚ùå FAILED
   - Added `--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages` to Dockerfile
   - Caused flaky builds without performance benefits
3. **Epic 2**: Cache effectiveness validation - ‚ùå VALIDATION FAILED
4. **Epic 3**: Production rollout - ‚ùå REVERTED

**Actual Outcome**: No pipeline improvement. Back to baseline ~180s performance. Caching approach unsuitable.

## Future Milestones (Reassessment Phase)
### Need New Approach: Docker layer caching proven ineffective
### Investigation Required: Alternative optimization strategies
### Potential Areas: E2E test optimization, build process simplification, dependency management

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Performance Targets
- üéØ **Ideal Target**: <60 seconds (67% reduction from current 180s)
- ‚úÖ **Acceptable Target**: <90 seconds (50% reduction)
- üìä **Milestone**: <120 seconds (33% reduction) ‚Üí investigate further optimizations

### Optimization Principles (Updated After Caching Failure)
- **Developer Productivity Focus**: Pipeline runs multiple times daily, fast feedback essential
- **Measurement-Driven**: Verify actual improvements with multiple test runs, not single measurements
- **Reliability First**: Avoid optimizations that introduce build instability
- **Simple Solutions**: Prefer straightforward approaches over complex caching mechanisms
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Avoid premium runners unless justified by significant gains

### Development Standards
- **Maintain Test Coverage**: Optimizations must not compromise E2E test reliability
- **Preserve Functionality**: All existing CI features must continue working
- **Measurement-Driven**: Track actual performance improvements with each change
- **Resource Awareness**: Monitor GitHub Actions cache usage and limits

## Known Constraints

### GitHub Actions Limitations
- **Cache Storage**: 10GB limit per repository, oldest entries evicted automatically
- **Cache Access**: Only current branch, base branch, and default branch caches accessible
- **Runner Performance**: Standard ubuntu-latest runners, upgrade costs vs. benefits

### Technical Dependencies
- **Docker Build Process**: Multi-stage build complexity affects caching efficiency
- **Artifact Size**: ~91MB Docker tar file for job transitions
- **Test Dependencies**: Cypress requires full application stack running

## Milestone 1 Results (Failed Implementation)

**Primary KPI**: Build job duration - NO IMPROVEMENT (remained ~45-60s)
**Secondary KPI**: Overall pipeline duration - NO IMPROVEMENT (remained ~180s)  
**Quality KPI**: Build reliability DEGRADED (flaky builds introduced)
**Resource KPI**: Cache storage used but provided no benefit

### Implementation Checklist (Post-Mortem)
- [x] **Epic 1.1**: GitHub Actions cache integration attempted and reverted ‚ùå
- [x] **Epic 1.2**: NuGet cache mounting attempted and reverted ‚ùå  
- [x] **Epic 2**: Cache effectiveness validation - proved ineffective ‚ùå
- [x] **Epic 3**: Production rollout - fully reverted ‚ùå
- [x] Initial measurements misleading - no reproducible benefits ‚ùå
- [x] Caching approach proven unsuitable for this project ‚ùå

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
