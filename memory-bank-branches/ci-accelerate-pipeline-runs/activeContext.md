# Active Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Optimize CI/CD pipeline performance to improve developer productivity and resource efficiency.

## Current Technical State

**Core Application Complete âœ…**:
- DFLD HTML parsing fully implemented (InMemoryMeasurementProvider)
- Area element grouping working (pairs HTML elements for time/date extraction)
- Time zone conversion (CET to UTC) implemented
- Backend API with proper request/response models
- Frontend-backend integration working
- Peak measurement selection logic implemented
- Comprehensive test infrastructure with DfldHtml test utility
- **Cypress E2E CI Pipeline**: Fully operational with Docker integration and automated testing

**Current Pipeline Performance**:
- **Total Runtime**: ~3 minutes (180 seconds)
- determine_tag: 2 seconds
- build: 49 seconds  
- e2e: 112 seconds
- **Resource Inefficiency**: No Docker layer caching, unnecessary buildx setup, large artifacts

## Next Steps - CI Optimization Sprint

### 1. Docker Layer Caching Implementation (High Impact: ~30-40s savings)
- Add GitHub Actions cache to Docker build process
- Implement `cache-from: type=gha` and `cache-to: type=gha,mode=max`
- Expected reduction: Build time from 49s to 10-15s for incremental changes

### 2. Remove Unnecessary Docker Buildx in E2E Job (Medium Impact: ~10-15s savings)
- E2E job only loads existing tar file, doesn't need buildx setup
- Eliminate redundant Docker setup steps
- Streamline container loading process

### 3. Cypress Dependencies Caching Optimization (Medium Impact: ~10-20s savings)
- Leverage built-in caching in `cypress-io/github-action@v6`
- Cache npm dependencies and Cypress binary between runs
- Optimize test execution environment setup

### 4. Job Structure Optimization (Medium Impact: ~5-10s savings)
- Eliminate redundant determine_tag job by generating tag within build job
- Explore parallel execution opportunities where dependencies allow
- Minimize job overhead and transitions

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Performance Targets
- ðŸŽ¯ **Ideal Target**: <60 seconds (67% reduction from current 180s)
- âœ… **Acceptable Target**: <90 seconds (50% reduction)
- ðŸ“Š **Milestone**: <120 seconds (33% reduction) â†’ investigate further optimizations

### Optimization Principles
- **Developer Productivity Focus**: Pipeline runs multiple times daily, fast feedback essential
- **Resource Efficiency**: Eliminate redundant rebuilds through intelligent caching
- **Incremental Approach**: Implement high-impact optimizations first, measure results
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Avoid premium runners unless justified by significant gains

### Development Standards
- **Maintain Test Coverage**: Optimizations must not compromise E2E test reliability
- **Preserve Functionality**: All existing CI features must continue working
- **Measurement-Driven**: Track actual performance improvements with each change
- **Resource Awareness**: Monitor GitHub Actions cache usage and limits

## Known Constraints

### GitHub Actions Limitations
- **Cache Storage**: 10GB limit per repository, oldest entries evicted automatically
- **Cache Access**: Only current branch, base branch, and default branch caches accessible
- **Runner Performance**: Standard ubuntu-latest runners, upgrade costs vs. benefits

### Technical Dependencies
- **Docker Build Process**: Multi-stage build complexity affects caching efficiency
- **Artifact Size**: ~91MB Docker tar file for job transitions
- **Test Dependencies**: Cypress requires full application stack running
