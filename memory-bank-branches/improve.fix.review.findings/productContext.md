# Product Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Why This Project Exists

Aircraft noise pollution significantly impacts quality of life for citizens near airports. The German Aviation Noise Service (DFLD) provides official measurement data, but citizens struggle to:
- Correlate their noise experiences with official measurements
- Navigate complex complaint processes
- Provide structured, data-backed complaints

## Problems This Solves

### For Citizens
- **Time-consuming manual work**: Eliminates need to manually search DFLD websites for noise data
- **Inaccurate complaints**: Provides verified noise levels instead of subjective assessments
- **Complex workflows**: Streamlines the complaint preparation process
- **Poor timing**: Enables real-time event recording during actual noise disturbances

### For Authorities
- **Better data quality**: Complaints backed by official measurement data
- **Structured information**: Consistent complaint format with precise timestamps
- **Increased legitimacy**: Official DFLD data strengthens complaint validity

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience
1. **Grant location permission** → System finds nearest DFLD measurement station
2. **Record noise events** → One-click timestamp capture during disturbances
3. **View mapped data** → See actual noise levels for recorded events
4. **Prepare complaints** → Export structured data for official submission

### Key Workflows

**During Noise Events**:
- Quick event recording with single button press
- Automatic timestamp capture
- Minimal user interaction required

**After Events**:
- Review recorded events with mapped noise levels
- Identify peak noise periods
- Generate structured complaint data

**Integration Points**:
- DFLD measurement station discovery via geolocation
- Real-time HTML parsing of DFLD measurement data
- Manual export to official complaint systems

## User Experience Goals

- **Immediate**: Record events without delay during noise disturbances
- **Accurate**: Backed by official measurement data
- **Simple**: Minimal steps from event to complaint
- **Transparent**: Clear display of official noise measurements

## Success Criteria

- Citizens can record noise events in under 3 seconds
- User satisfaction with complaint process quality
