# Product Context - Aircraft Noise Complaint Assistant

## Why This Project Exists

Citizens struggle to correlate noise experiences with official DFLD measurements and navigate complex complaint processes to file structured, data-backed complaints.

## Core User Experience

1. **Grant location permission** → System finds nearest DFLD measurement station
2. **Record noise events** → One-click timestamp capture during disturbances
3. **View mapped data** → See actual noise levels for recorded events
4. **Prepare complaints** → Export structured data for official submission

## User Experience Goals

- **Immediate**: Record events without delay during noise disturbances
- **Accurate**: Backed by official measurement data
- **Simple**: Minimal steps from event to complaint
- **Transparent**: Clear display of official noise measurements
